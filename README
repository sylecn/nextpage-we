** how to test web extension on localhost?
- Open "about:debugging" in Firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select
  any file in your extension's directory.

  You can also use web-ext to load temporary WebExtensions from the command line.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext
  this requires node LTS and npm.

- for Chrome, open Extensions page, click load unpacked extension, choose the
  src dir.

** how to build extension for distribution?
just run make

This will create zip files that you can upload to firefox/chrome developer
page.

<link>: The External Resource Link element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#attributes
firefox doesn't support link prefetch?

- prefetch is supported by all 3.
  prerender is supported by chrome.

- put this feature behind a flag. disabled by default.

  (enable-prefetch)
  (enable-prerender)

  <link rel="prefetch" href="/images/big.jpeg" />
  <link rel="prerender" href="/page/2" >

  when to add these elements to DOM? after page load.
  just add in nextpage.js load time, if feature is enabled.

- create a test page to test this feature.
  https://nextpage.emacsos.com/prefetch-test/1
  https://nextpage.emacsos.com/prefetch-test/2
  https://nextpage.emacsos.com/prefetch-test/3

  put a lot of text and image on each page.
  have next page and prev page link on each page.

  <link rel="prefetch" href="/images/big.jpeg" as="image" />

- if it works, update command in usage.html.
  add notes on prerender is not supported by firefox.

  prefetch works in firefox.
  prerender works in chrome/msedge.

- problems
  - in chrome, load unpacked no longer works
    I can't see any files, only dir. click open doesn't add local extension.

    drop file from file manager to that page also fail.
    "drop to install" shows, but does nothing.

    is it affected by chrome local admin?
    /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/policy001.json

    xorg/chrome.sls:/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/policy001.json

    nope. still fail to install.

    chrome://policy/

    try drop policy. still fail to install local addon.

  - try it in windows.
    in ryzen5 winten02 VM.

    cp -r build/chrome/ ~/d/shared/nextpage-chrome/
    it works in windows 10.

    prerender works very well on freebsd handbook and bing search result
    page. I would like to enable it by default. User can disable it via config
    file.

  - auxclick works. mouse-2 and mouse-3.

  - add "return false".
    nope.

  - Element: contextmenu event - Web APIs | MDN
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/contextmenu_event

    Any right-click event that is not disabled (by calling the event's
    preventDefault() method) will result in a contextmenu event being fired at
    the targeted element.

    Element: auxclick event - Web APIs | MDN
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/auxclick_event

    Additionally, you may need to avoid opening a system context menu after a
    right click. Due to timing differences between operating systems, this too
    is not a preventable default behavior of auxclick. Instead, this can be
    done by preventing the default behavior of the contextmenu event.

    MouseEvent.button - Web APIs | MDN
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/button

    Users may change the configuration of buttons on their pointing device so
    that if an event's button property is zero, it may not have been caused by
    the button that is physically left–most on the pointing device; however,
    it should behave as if the left button was clicked in the standard button
    layout.

  - works in firefox.
    in chrome, mouse-2 and mouse-3 event not triggered.

    two nextpage installed.
    load unpacked extension will not replace the extension installed from webstore.

    try use a chrome profile just for testing this extension.

** 2019-08-23 support previous-page command.
** 2019-08-23 describeKeyInEmacsNotation bug. shift+p should be "P", not S-p
just like *.

C-S-l ==> same as C-l
S-l   ==> L
M-S-l ==> M-L

the emacs rules are kind of complicated.
I should add some test case for this.
if control key and letter keys are pressed, ignore and consume shift key.

- test cases:
  | press | emacs notation |
  |-------+----------------|
  | l     | l              |
  | S-l   | L              |
  | 8     | 8              |
  | *     | *              |
  | C-l   | C-l            |
  | C-L   | C-l            |
  | M-l   | M-l            |
  | M-L   | M-L            |
  | C-M-L | C-M-l          |
  | C-*   | C-*            |
  | C-M-* | C-M-*          |
  | C-.   | C-.            |
  | C->   | C->            |

** 2019-08-22 describeKeyInEmacsNotation() is not reliable.
"C-S-," should be C-< in emacs notation.
keyCode is S-KEYCODE188
all symbols that requires shift key to press have this problem.
"*", not S-8

- DONE support (bind "C-." 'nextpage)
- DONE support (bind "C-S-b" 'nextpage)
- DONE support (bind "C-(" 'nextpage)
               (bind "C-<" 'nextpage)
- DONE support (bind "*" 'nextpage)

  "-" key is 173 in firefox 68.0.2.
  "-" key is 189 in chrome 76.0.x.

  e.key will be '-' in both browser.

  use e.key can't support <kp-2> keys, because browser just return "2". so I
  continue to use keyCode to support more keys.

** 2019-08-22 keypress event to keydown event. fix issue #41.
- problems
  - press C-i will trigger two events. one for ctrl, one for C-i.
    I should ignore pure modifier key events.
    I don't plan to support key chain.
  - I can capture some built-in hotkey after switching to keydown event.
    in chrome, C-o, C-h, C-c all send to my extension. C-n is not sent.

    can I block default behavior by returning false?
  - TODO bug in firefox. press p will go previous page, then immediately go next page.

    reproduce:

    open debian install manual. https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/
    press n
    press p
    expect see previous page, but see previous page, then immediately see next
    page.

    No problem in chrome.

    it's because nextpageLink.click(); send a <mouse-1> click.
    my ext got that click event. but there is no binding for this key.

    - open debian install manual.
      press n
      press toolbar back button. has the same issue.
      looks like a bug of firefox.

      only debian install manual have the problem? not all page have this
      problem. ignore this bug for now.

    - firefox 68 doesn't have the problem. maybe it's firefox profile issue.

** 2018-04-05 publish extension on chrome webstore
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard

- release it now.

- Detailed description, can I include links?
  no.

- need a few 1280x800 screenshot

  could be any design of that size. doesn't necessarily a screenshot.

  ~/d/nextpage-screenshots/

  sc example pages in 640x400

  // image quality is very poor on desktop browser.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Applications and themes require at least one screenshot. Extensions may have
  no screenshots, but such extensions won't be shown in Chrome Web Store's
  browse functions.

  Provide preferably 4 or 5 screenshots of your app (up to a maximum of 5). If
  your app supports multiple locales, you can provide locale-specific
  screenshots. Your screenshot should have square corners and no padding (full
  bleed).

  We prefer screenshots to be 1280x800 pixels in size, as they will be used in
  future high dpi displays. Currently, the Chrome Web Store will downscale all
  screenshots to 640x400, so if your screenshots will not look good downscaled
  (eg. have a lot of text) or if 1280x800 is too big for your app (screenshot
  of low resolution game), we also support 640x400 pixels screenshots.
  #+END_QUOTE

  For now, I should use 640x400 images.

  just put 2 images, one intro, one options page.

- should I enable GA for it?

- A one-time developer registration fee of US$5.00 is required to verify your
  account and publish items. Learn more

  paid.

- publish okay.

- problems
  - I see this notice on developer dashboard.

    As of November 21st, 2016, all newly published packaged or hosted apps are
    restricted to Chrome OS, and are not available to users on Windows, Mac or
    Linux.

    All packaged and hosted apps will be removed from Chrome Web Store search
    & browse functions in mid-December 2017. Existing apps will continue to
    work and receive updates.

    Chromium Blog: From Chrome Apps to the Web
    https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html

    //WTF?

    DONE I will read it later. if the store doesn't work, just upload to
    https://emacsos.com/misc/nextpage-chrome.zip

    this only affects chrome apps. is web extension one kind of chrome apps?
    nope. it's for apps like atom editor, which is a desktop app that is built
    on top of chromium.

** 2018-04-04 feature request: allow bind copy-title-and-url-maybe.
this is for myself. not in default config.
I can remove the tabcopy add-on and copy fixer add-on when this is done.

(bind "C-c" 'copy-title-and-url-maybe)

make it work in both firefox and chrome.

- add command implementation

  add in nextpage.js,
  copyTitleAndUrl
  copyTitleAndUrlMaybe

- update config file parser.
  in options.js,
  update VALID_COMMANDS

- update interpreter
  in nextpage.js,
  runUserCommand

- well, since commands work differently in chrome.
  I can bind c instead of Ctrl-C.

- I will get rid of background script and commands.

- problems
  - how to check whether some text is selected?
    I think I have this code somewhere.

    var selection = window.getSelection();

  - how to copy text to clipboard?

    just check how TabCopy do it.

    ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/micdllihgoppmejpecmkilggmaagfdmb/
    copyToClipboard()

    it modify doc.oncopy to manually overwrite clipboardData, then call
    doc.execCommand('copy') so the oncopy event handler is run.

    this is mentioned in
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/copy

  - TODO bug: when saving user config, no warning given when there is unknown
    command.

  - in chrome, C-c doesn't trigger runUserCommand() at all.

    (enable-debug-for-key-events)

    no keypress event when press C-c in chrome.

    Since I can't reuse the infrastructures, I will create a separate
    extension for this.

    How about firefox, does it support this?
    it works in firefox.

    how to know C-c is pressed in chrome? TabCopy can do it.

    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/events
    which events are available in chrome? most apis.

    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index
    commands API.

    commands only work with background script (event pages).
    need to send command event to content script to copy page's title and url.
    (in bg.js, it will get bg.js's document url, I tried it.)

    works now. although I didn't see the default hotkey shown anywhere in
    chrome UI.

    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/commands
    The user can manually add more shortcuts from the
    chrome://extensions/configureCommands dialog.
    (Extensions > Keyboard Shortcuts)

  - how to communicate between background script and content script?
    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging

  - C-c doesn't work in options.html textarea, when it's used to copy-title-and-url-maybe.

    problem went away after I removed bg.js and commands.
    I don't need those anyway.

** 2018-04-04 bug: in firefox, doc link doesn't link to help page in preferences page.
- see also the bug in waiting section. that's mozilla's add-on website.
- in chrome, there is a "Help" button, which opens the help page.

// this is not a problem. there is a help button on both firefox and chrome.

** 2018-03-13 make it work in chrome browser.
- create a new manifest.json for chrome. drop some unsupported keys.
- make browser.storage.sync optional in nextpage.js and options.js
  or use chrome's sync object.
- I tried it on x201 today. n key already works. SPC key doesn't work.

- 2018-04-04 continue this.
  I designed the firefox extension first.
  I will focus on
  - how to sync user configuration across sessions.

    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/options

    Use the storage.sync API to persist these preferences. These values will
    then become accessible in any script within your extension, on all your
    user's devices.

    chrome.storage.sync.set(data, callback);
    chrome.storage.sync.get(keyWithDefaultValues, callback);

- fix any bugs.
  - nextpage.js:905 browser is not defined
    nextpage.js:979

    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage#type-StorageArea
    StorageArea api is not the same.
    in firefox, .get return a Promise.
    in chrome, you pass in a callback function.

    wait, I used .then() api in firefox. not callback.
    do I need to create a wrapper for storage access?

    search: chrome.storage.sync browser.storage.sync wrapper

    seems none exists. I will create one, just for my needs.

    That's just reading user's parsed config. fixed.

  - preferences page doesn't show up.
    update manifest.json, key is different.

  - fix storage usage in options.html
    options.js:7, :273

    I split store code in storage.js
    I need to load/include this file in both nextpage.js and options.js.

    fix store usage in options.js

  - fix browser.i18n.getMessage in options.js
    document.getElementById(elementId).firstChild.nodeValue = browser.i18n.getMessage(messageId);

- all test pages work in chrome now.
  test this build in firefox dev env.
  make sure I didn't break anything.

  all test page works in firefox.

- problems
  - try load the unpacked addon.
    - manifest.json
      - Unrecognized manifest key 'applications'.
      - found unexpected key 'browser_style'
    search: one manifest.json file for both chrome and firefox extension

    I will use jinja2 template.
    Can I use m4 for this?

    Since there are only two browsers, and manifest file is not updated very
    frequently, I will just use two files.

    DONE update build process to use manifest-chrome.json for chrome browser.
  - how to pack for chrome?
    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting
    it's just zip file, same as firefox.
    DONE I will create a build dir since manifest file is different.
  - after split storage.js, I listed two js files in content_scripts js.
    but the later js file can't access the variables defined in first js file.

    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#execution-environment

    only page script and content script is isolated.
    doesn't say anything about content scripts in one extension.
    if js files in each content script is isolated, there is no use to include
    jquery as an example there.

    Are content scripts supposed to share a single global namespace? - Google Groups
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chromium-extensions/-xdbFNr7Q2I

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    All content scripts for the same extension/page pair should share a
    context. If you aren't seeing this, it is a bug.
    #+END_QUOTE

    it's my problem. use var to define global variable.
    now it works.
  - in chrome, SPC key doesn't goto next page when at page bottom.
    n key does work.

    window.scrollMaxY <= window.scrollY
    this is always false in chrome.

    window.scrollMaxY is undefined in chrome, so it's always <= a number.
    scrollMaxY is not standard.

    search: detect scrolled to bottom
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9439725/javascript-how-to-detect-if-browser-window-is-scrolled-to-bottom
    (window.innerHeight + window.scrollY) >= document.body.offsetHeight

    fixed.
  - doesn't goto next page on debian site.
    try enable debugging.
    (enable-debug)
    (enable-debug-goto-next-page)

    it finds the next page link, but failed to follow the link.
    <LINK rel="next"> href=https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/pr01.html.en

    maybe .click() is not supported on this node in chrome.

    test page:
    https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/
    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head');
    var lastElement = head[0].lastElementChild;
    lastElement
    lastElement.click()
    the click() function is defined, but it doesn't goto that URL in chrome.

    document.location.href = lastElement.href;

    (lastElement.tagName.toUpperCase() === "LINK")

    fixed.

  - validator doesn't like usage of .innerHTML
    how to update h3 and span in javascript without using innerHTML?

    search: update span without using innerHTML
    using innerText
    or textContent

    myDiv.childNodes[0].nodeValue = "The text has been changed.";

    document.getElementById('elementid').firstChild.nodeValue = new_text;

** 2017-10-19 run jslint on my js files
make check

** 2017-10-19 implement I18N for options window and manifest file.

- problems
  - do I need to use javascript to rewrite HTML tags in options.html?
    that will be boring.

    search: firefox web extension option page I18N

    title and labels shows nothing.
    add-on name is also not reflected on UI.

    try restart firefox

  - There was an error during installation: Extension is invalid

    search: firefox There was an error during installation: Extension is invalid

    works when I add messages.json for zh_CN. maybe it doesn't like empty
    locale dirs.

    now i18n works.

  - how to check zh_CN locale options page.
    about:config
    general.useragent.locale
    set to zh-CN
    need to restart firefox.

    addon name and description works.
    options page still show English.
    options page only fetch English message.json, not other languages.
    confirm in zh-CN and zh locale, it doesn't fetch _locale/zh_CN/messages.json

    search: browser.i18n.getMessage always fetch English

** 2017-10-18 disabled website 可以开放出来了。fix bug #15
(ignore-on "https://www.qidian.com/")
(ignore-on "https://.*\.qidian\.com/")

both works. cool.

- parse this command in options.js

  how to do proper parsing? there may be escapes in the string.
  just use regexp for now. don't care escapes.

- use the parse result in nextpage.js
- document it in usage.html

** 2017-10-18 add an options page. store user hotkeys somewhere.
- make user config file backward compatible.
- ~/projects/firefox/nextpage/src/chrome/content/config.jsm
- the old preferences window
  config file: ~/.config/nextpage.lisp

  built-in config:
  (bind "SPC" 'nextpage-maybe)
  (bind "n" 'nextpage)
  (bind "p" 'history-back)

  user config:
  <text area>

  [save & reload] [reload only] [Help]
- just remake it using WE api.
  Options page - Mozilla | MDN
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Options_pages

  reading a local text file is impossible now.
  maybe for security reasons.
  I will need to store the user configuration somewhere else.

  just use add-on storage api.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/Storage

  parse result:
  see parseUserConfig docstring.

  make sure this works:
  1. open webpage. n, p, space works.
  2. change user config.
     #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
       ;; user config
       (enable-debug)
       (bind "SPC" 'nextpage-maybe)
       (bind "M-n" 'nextpage)
       (bind "p" 'history-back)
     #+END_SRC
     save and reload.
  3. open new webpage. M-n, p, SPC works.
  4. in old webpage. default key works. M-n doesn't.
- make mouse click work.
- if user clear user config, clear the parsed config key.
- update src/usage.html, there is no longer "file" concept.

  To retain old behavior, if user doesn't say unbind-all, all built-in binding
  should continue work.
- 

- problems
  - how should the two communicate? content script and options page?
    I can just read key map from storage api. this way it's always latest.
    when reload, just parse user config and store it in another key.

    notify page script to update a lexical binding is better.
    especially those debug variables.
    I don't like reading from pref for all of them.

    It will make things too complicated. Just make config work in new
    tabs. Leave existing tabs alone.
  - DONE remove all occurrence of in_overlay checks
  - storage saved in browser.storage.sync can't get back.
    storage.local has the same problem.
    I can't get back what I put in.

    I see the problem.
    let setKey = store.set({
	    STORAGE_KEY_USER_CONFIG: newUserConfig,
	    STORAGE_KEY_PARSED_CONFIG: parsedUserConfig
    });
    the capital name becomes object literal, not constant!
    you can force evaluation of the const using [CONST_NAME].

    works now.
  - 

** DONE 2017-10-18 make basic things work.
2017-10-18 16:46:15 basic things work.
test whether there are any js errors, then make a commit.

- problems
  - can I put my code in multiple files and compile them to one?
    I want to use es2015 modules.

    search: can I use es2015 modules in firefox web extension

    search: compile es2015 modules to a single javascript file

    I will keep it simple. just use old javascript.

  - DONE search for content\. after migrating. content is not needed in WE.
